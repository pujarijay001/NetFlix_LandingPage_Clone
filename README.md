# Netflix Landing Page Clone 🎬

A responsive **Netflix landing page clone** built using **HTML5 and CSS3**, focused on layout, responsiveness, and modern UI patterns.

This project was built over **~3 days** and intentionally avoids JavaScript to understand how far **semantic HTML + CSS** can go in building real-world interfaces.

## 📌 Project Goals

- Clone the **Netflix landing page UI** as closely as possible
- Practice **layout structuring** and **responsive design**
- Understand how **modern websites think about spacing, hierarchy, and components**
- Learn how to manage **complex CSS at scale**

---

## 🧠 Problems Faced (Real Struggles)

### 1️⃣ Managing Layout & Element Relationships
One of the biggest challenges was **making different sections work together**:
- Hero section with background image + overlay
- Header alignment (logo, language selector, sign-in)
- Centering content both vertically and horizontally
- Maintaining consistent widths (`70vw`, `90vw`) across sections

This taught me that modern layouts are not about random margins — they are about:
- Containers
- Consistent max-widths
- Flexbox/Grid thinking in terms of **structure**, not just positioning

---

### 2️⃣ Handling Media Queries for Multiple Devices
Another major challenge was **responsive behavior** across:
- Mobile (≤600px)
- Tablet (≤1024px)
- Laptop & large screens (≤1400px)

Problems faced:
- Text becoming too large/small
- Grid layouts breaking
- Buttons and inputs overflowing
- Sliders and posters needing size adjustments

This forced me to think in **breakpoints**, not devices:
- What should change?
- What should stay consistent?
- When should layout collapse vs resize?

---

### 3️⃣ Managing CSS Scale & Organization
As the project grew, CSS became harder to manage:
- Repeated widths and spacing
- Multiple sections sharing similar behavior
- Hover states, transitions, and animations

This highlighted the importance of:
- Reusable patterns
- Variables (`:root`)
- Logical section grouping
- Writing CSS that is **predictable**, not magical

## 💡 What I Learned From This Project

### 🏗 How Modern Websites Are Built
- Websites are **systems**, not pages
- Layouts are planned around containers and sections
- Spacing and hierarchy matter more than colors
- Most UI is intentionally simple — complexity is hidden

---

### 🧩 How Developers Think About Layout
- Flexbox/Grid are used to define **relationships**
- Widths are constrained to improve readability
- Mobile-first thinking avoids future problems
- Visual hierarchy guides user attention

---

### 🎯 UI Logic Over Decoration
- Borders vs margins vs backgrounds serve different purposes
- Animations are subtle and meaningful (not flashy)
- Accessibility is baked into HTML (`<details>`, `<summary>`, forms)

---

### 📱 Responsive Design Mindset
- Not “make it smaller”
- But **rearrange content intelligently**
- Prioritize readability and usability
- Accept that not everything scales — some things adapt

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- HTML5 (semantic structure)
- CSS3
  - Flexbox
  - Grid
  - Media Queries
  - CSS Variables
  - Transitions & animations
- Google Fonts (Roboto)

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add JavaScript for:
  - Slider controls
  - Form validation
- Improve accessibility (focus-visible states)
- Convert CSS to SCSS for better structure
- Pixel-perfect comparison with real Netflix UI
